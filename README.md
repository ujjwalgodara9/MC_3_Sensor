# Real-Time Orientation App

## Overview
This project involves developing a mobile application that utilizes the smartphone's accelerometer to collect and display real-time orientation data. The application includes two main functionalities:
1. Real-time display of the smartphone's orientation using three angles.
2. Collection and storage of orientation data over time, which can then be visualized as three separate graphs.

## Features
- **Real-time Orientation Display:** The app shows the phone's orientation in terms of three angles that update in real-time.
- **Data Collection and Storage:** Orientation data is collected and stored in a database for later analysis.
- **Historical Data Visualization:** The app displays the collected orientation data as three graphs showing the history of the angles over time.
